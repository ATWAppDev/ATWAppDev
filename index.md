## Memorise - JLPT Vocab
Thanks for using Memorise.

We love words.
Words are the building blocks of a language.
Let's build your Japanese language using Memorise.

Memorise is a JLPT vocab memoriser.
You can study all vocabs needed for JLPT(N5~N1).

To use this app:
You just need to know 
あいうえお, アイウエオ.

You can:
study words.
practise words.
view list of words.
memorise by listening words.

We recommend you to prepare TTS(Text to Speech) for English(U.S) & Japanese.
(Normally, Android/iOS will automatically install necessary voice data when needed.)
If TTS is okay, you can listen sound by touching words.

Special thanks:
JLPT Vocab data from Mr.Jonathan Waller.
