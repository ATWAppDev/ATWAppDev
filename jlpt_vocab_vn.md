## JLPT Vocab Vietnam
Thanks for using JLPT Vocab Vietnam.

We love words.  
Words are the building blocks of a language.  
Let's build your Japanese language using JLPT Vocab Vietnam.  

JLPT Vocab Vietnam is a JLPT vocab memoriser.  
You can study vocabs needed for JLPT(N5~N2).

To use this app:  
You just need to know   
あいうえお, アイウエオ.

You can:  
study words.  
practise words.  
view list of words.  
memorise by listening words.  
memorise by playing games.  

We recommend you to prepare TTS(Text to Speech) for Vietnamese & Japanese.  
(Normally, Android/iOS will automatically install necessary voice data when needed.)  
If TTS is okay, you can listen sound by touching words.
